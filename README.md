# Calendar made to practice TypeScript & Tailwind

This is a practice project from the course "TypeScript simplified" from https://courses.webdevsimplified.com/

I started by doing everything myself before watching WebDevSimplified's solution, and afterwards applied some of his solutions that was much better than what I did.

I am aware of date libraries that would make some things easier but I wanted to work with vanilla JS dates to get a better understanding of them.

## Things to add

- Different view for small screens
- Dark mode
- Filter colors
